This was an interesting project. I learned quite a bit about LiteDb and Minimal API. Minimal API really simplifies what it takes to create a RESTful service.

I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to use LiteDb in Unit Testing. I settled on using the MemoryStream so that I would not leave anything on the test machine.
I think this worked well.

Overall, I really enjoyed learning a number of new features of .net. It has been a while since I had that opportunity.
